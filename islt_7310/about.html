    <h1>Sarah Michaels</h1>
   <p>My name is Sarah Michaels. I live in Harrisonville, MO and I am in my final year working on completing my Bachelor's in Educational Studies after nearly a 20-year hiatus. I currently work full time for an online K-12 school as an Instructional Developer. I also work almost full time as a technology coordinator overseeing several teams of instructional developers implement higher ed level course builds. I love both of my jobs and hope to obtain skills in this class that will help me continue to do the work I do. I have 5 kids, ages 21, 20, 19 and then a big jump to 8-year-old twins. I also have 3 dogs and 1 cat. When I have spare time, I love to travel, read, do crafts and have adventures with my kids. I enjoy watching live sports of any kind, but baseball is my absolute favorite.
