<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Hi, Welcome to my website! <br>
    Here I will tell you a little bit about myself and my experience in the world of <strong>instructional development</strong>. My goal is to inspire you to know that <em>you can</em> pursue your goals, no matter what age or other responsibilities you have in your life. It is never too late to discover your passion and pursue it. I worked in a job for almost two decades that was not fulfilling in the least but it provided for my family and offered stability. Without a college degree, I felt stuck. That is, until I took on a part time job helping out a friend working in online learning systems. I worked that job part time for 8 years before I took the leap and followed my dreams and made it a full time reality. It has been 3 years since then and I have not had one single regret.</p>
