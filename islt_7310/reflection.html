    <h2>Reflection</h2>
   
    <p>I worked as an Office Manager for an aerospace rubber and plastic manufacturer for almost 20 years. My commute was 45 minutes in heavy traffic one way. My day consisted of communicating with engineers world-wide and lots of stress. We were always understaffed, and it was challenging to take any time off. I was unhappy to say the least but felt absolutely stuck.</p>
    <p>A close friend of mine, who knew my high-level attention to detail, asked me to help out on a small contract job working for the distance education high school that she worked at as it was being converted to fully online. I fell absolutely in love. That small contract job continued for the next 8 years.</p>
    <p>I finally took the leap and left my high stress full time job to work full time remotely for Mizzou Academy and it has been the absolute best decision for me. It has allowed me to finish my education and supported my goals to learn more about how to design and develop online courses.</p>
    <p>My full-time role as an instructional developer has also inspired me to learn more about accessibility and has awoken a passion in me to become a subject matter expert in accessibility. I believe that all students deserve to have the same educational experience, no matter their abilities. </p>
